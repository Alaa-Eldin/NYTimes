# NYTimes
Application to fetch NYTimes news using VIPER

# Notes
- There are no third parties used just for sake of showing off the ability to replace hundereds of unnecessary lines of codes.
- I did not consider the connectivity check before requesting the APIs for time limitation reasons.
- I added Property List file to add all sections available or remove existing ones easily from a readble file.
- I added a name property for sections to be able to show for example a user-friendly list of sections where he can select what he wants.
- Maybe there is a way to fetch the sections from NYTimes APIs but I did not find it in my available time.
- I chose to use clean archticture for sake of showing off my abilities only. Off course we can use MVVM or MVP if we need to.
- I did not write enough unit testing cases for lake of time but I test the basics which the application needs as inputs to operate.
- I have long experience of unit testing and continuous integratrion using jenkins and continuous delivery using fastlane.
