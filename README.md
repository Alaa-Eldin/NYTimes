# NYTimes
Application to fetch NYTimes news using VIPER

# Notes
- The application is being developed on Xcode 10.0, if you run on the same version you should not get any warnings.
- I added Property List file to add all sections available or remove existing ones easily from a readble file.
- I added a name property for sections to be able to show for example a user-friendly list of sections where he can select what he wants.
- Maybe there is a way to fetch the sections from NYTimes APIs but I did not find it in my available time.
